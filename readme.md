# Parallelism Test Repository

This repository is a playground for testing and exploring parallelism in Python by combining asynchronous programming, multithreading, and multiprocessing. The goal is to experiment with different concurrency models and understand their strengths and limitations in various scenarios.

## Overview

Parallelism is a crucial aspect of modern computing, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently, leading to improved performance and resource utilization. This repository provides a set of Python scripts and examples that utilize asynchronous programming, multithreading, and multiprocessing to achieve parallelism on different levels.
